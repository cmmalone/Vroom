    Github repo set up, obstacles, roads, time_stepper and test_script uploaded
    ChangeLog established for, uh, logging changes (notes on what's being committed, 
        branched, whatever)
    README gives startup instructions and summarizes classes and methods

    Moved instantiation of roads and cars into roads_init and obstacles_init, in anticipation
        of these becoming larger files where whole road networks and fleets of cars can be
        initialized
    Added a terminal obstacle that gets added to each road upon instantiation, so that calling
        getNearestObstacle() on the front obstacle doesn't make the code break
